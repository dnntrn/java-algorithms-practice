#Java Algorithms Practice

This repo documents all of the algorithms I solve as I work to improve as a programmer! (Medium post may be coming)

##[LeetCode] (https://leetcode.com/dnntrn/)

* ZigZag Conversion
    - [LC link] (https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)
    - [My Solution] ()
    - Description of the problem:
          The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this:
          ```
          P   A   H   N 
          A P L S I I G
          Y   I   R
          ```
          And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

          Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows.

* Climbing the Leaderboard
    - [HR link] (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/climbing-the-leaderboard/problem)
    - [My Solution] ()
    - Description of the problem:
        Alice is playing an arcade game and wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and 
        wants to track her ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking.

        Complete the climbingLeaderboard function. It should return an integer res[j]
        array where each element represents Alice's rank after the jth game.

* Lily's Homework
    - [HR link] (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/lilys-homework/problem)
    - [My Solution] ()
    - Description of the problem:
        Consider an array of  distinct integers, arr = [a[0], a[1], ... a[n-1]]. George can swap any two 
        elements of the array any number of times. An array is beautiful if the sum of  |arr[i] - arr[i-1]| 
        among 0 < i < n is minimal.

        Given the array , determine and return the minimum number of swaps that should be performed in order 
        to make the array beautiful.
